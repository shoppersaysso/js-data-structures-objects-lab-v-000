// // Write your solution in this file!
// updateDriverWithKeyAndValue()- this function should take in a driver object, a key and a value.
// The function should not mutate the driver parameter and return a new driver that has an updated value for the key passed in.
//
//
// destructivelyUpdateDriverWithKeyAndValue() - this function should work the same as updateDriverWithKeyAndValue()
// but it should mutate the driver parameter passed in.
//
// deleteFromDriverByKey() - this function should take in a driver object and a key.
// It should delete the key/value pair for the key that was passed in from the driver object.
// This should all not actually mutate the driver passed in.
//
// destructivelyDeleteFromDriverByKey() - this function should work the same as deleteFromDriverByKey()
// but it should mutate the driver passed in.
